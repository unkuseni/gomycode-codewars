What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, your task will consist of gathering 300 points from solving problems in CodeWars. 


Instructions

150 points will be earned from pre-selected problems, covering the basics (loop, conditional, data types, etc..)
150 points will be earned flexibly, allowing you to choose freely the problems to solve (different difficulties reward different points (2, 8, 32, & 128 for the most difficult levels).
The pre-selected problems are all beginner level (thus providing 2 points per solution).

PS: Keep in mind that some points are automatically given to the user when ranking up (and other activities not necessarily related to solving problems. A Full explanation of how the points system works can be found here). 

Selected problems can be found in this list
